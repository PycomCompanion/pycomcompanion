# PycomCompanion
A Basic Android App Companion for PyCom Devices

## About
This app is designed for use with PyCom devices which use the SiPy board and the Sigfox protocol. Any data sent from a device using the SiPy, such as a PyTrack or PySense, can be viewed in this app.

PyCom Companion is in an early stage and is not considered complete yet. More work has yet to be done. It was created as an in-house way for us to easily view and manage the data coming from our multiple Sigfox-enabled PyTrack and PySense devices.
